### Class:FileEncryptor

Description: This class handles file encryption and decryption using symmetric encryption (Fernet).

Constructor:
- FileEncryptor(key=None): Initializes the `FileEncryptor` with a given key. If no key is provided, a new key is generated.
  - key (bytes): A bytes object representing the encryption key. If `None`, a new key is generated.

Methods:
- encrypt_file(file_path): Encrypts the specified file.
  - file_path (str): The path to the file to encrypt.
  - Returns: None
  
- decrypt_file(file_path): Decrypts the specified file.
  - file_path (str): The path to the file to decrypt.
  - Returns: None

- get_key(): Returns the encryption key used by the encryptor.
  - Returns: byte
