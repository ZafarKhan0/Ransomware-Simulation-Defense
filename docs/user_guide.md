## Using the Ransomware Simulation

### Running the Simulation
To simulate a ransomware attack, run the `ransomware_simulation.py` script:


python src/simulation/ransomware_simulation.py --target-dir /path/to/target


### Configuring the Simulation
You can customize the simulation by editing the script or passing arguments, such as:
- --target-dir: The directory to encrypt files in.
- --ransom-note: Path to save the ransom note.

### Example

python src/simulation/ransomware_simulation.py --target-dir ~/Documents/test_files --ransom-note ~/Documents/test_files/README.txt


#### 4. Using Defense Tools
Guide users on how to use the backup manager, decryption tool, and detection features.


## Using Defense Tools

### Backup Manager
To create a backup of your files:

python src/defense/backup_manager.py --source-dir /path/to/source --backup-dir /path/to/backup


To restore a backup:

python src/defense/backup_manager.py --restore --backup-dir /path/to/backup --restore-dir /path/to/restore

### Decryption Tool
To decrypt files encrypted by the simulation:

python src/defense/decryption_tool.py --target-dir /path/to/encrypted --key your-encryption-key


### Detection
To detect ransomware-like activity:

python src/defense/detection.py --target-dir /path/to/scan


### Example

python src/defense/detection.py --target-dir ~/Documents/encrypted_files


#### 5. Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions.


## Troubleshooting

- Issue: Files are not encrypting.
  - Solution: Ensure that the target directory path is correct and that you have read/write permissions.

- Issue: Unable to decrypt files.
- Solution: Verify that you are using the correct encryption key and that the files were encrypted with this tool.
